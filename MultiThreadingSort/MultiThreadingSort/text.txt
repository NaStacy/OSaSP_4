Eight year-old orphan Beth Harmon is quiet, sullen, and by all appearances unremarkable. 
That is, until she plays her first game of chess. Her senses grow sharper, her thinking clearer,

sheâ€™s competing for the U.S. Open championship. But as Beth hones her skills on the professional
circuit, the stakes get higher, her isolation grows more frightening, and the thought of escape
becomes all the more tempting.
